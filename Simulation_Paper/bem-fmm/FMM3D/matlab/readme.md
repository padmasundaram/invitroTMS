This folder contains the MATLAB wrappers, legacy wrappers for FMMLIB3D, 
and precompiled mex interfaces for MacOSX and Linux.

We strongly recommend recompiling the mex interfaces (see 
https://fmm3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html for detailed installation 
instructions).

Example codes for demonstrating the Helmholtz and Laplace interfaces are
``hfmm3d_example.m`` and ``lfmm3d_example.m``.

Example codes for demonstrating the legacy Helmholtz and Laplace wrappers are
``test_hfmm3dpart_direct.m`` and ``test_lfmm3dpart_direct.m``.
